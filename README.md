# EVE Market Tool

# What is this?

A tool to help you track items you buy in one station, import to another, and then sell there.

Goals:

- Make it possible to manage a large number of sell orders in less time
- Understand the profit possibilities of items you are about to import
- Understand when it's profitable to relist an item, and help you avoid relisting when it's not
- Understand when it's profitable to list an item in your hangar
- Avoid selling items at a loss
- Optimized for higher volume, quick turnover, but perhaps lower margin sales.

# How to get it

For the desktop version, head over to the releases page and grab the latest eve-market-track-win32-x64.zip file.

https://github.com/TrenzaloreStrax/market-tool/releases/

Unzip the file and run eve-market-track.exe inside it. You might have to allow it to run because I
haven't signed the executable and it'll come up as "unknown publisher". I'm probably not going to
infect your PC with malware, so go ahead and allow that, or don't, I don't care.

For the web version, head over to:
