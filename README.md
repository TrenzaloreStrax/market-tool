# EVE Market Tool

# How to get it

Head over to the releases page and grab the latest eve-market-track-win32-x64.zip file.

https://github.com/TrenzaloreStrax/market-tool/releases/

Unzip the file and run eve-market-track.exe inside it. You might have to allow it to run because I
haven't signed the executable and it'll come up as "unknown publisher". I'm probably not going to
infect your PC with malware, so go ahead and allow that, or don't, I don't care.
